Service Discovery: Netflix Eureka is used for service registration and discovery, allowing services to locate and communicate with each other dynamically.

API Gateway: A single entry point for all client requests, handled by Spring Cloud Gateway. It's responsible for routing, authentication, and cross-cutting concerns.

Asynchronous Communication: RabbitMQ is used for asynchronous communication between services, ensuring loose coupling and improved fault tolerance.
